19: Mindfulness and Presence in Music Production
- Cultivate a sense of mindfulness and presence in your music production process, allowing yourself to become fully immersed in the creative experience
- Exercise: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, before starting your music production sessions; aim to maintain a fully focused and present state while composing, arranging, or mixing

20: Always Challenge Yourself
- Continuously seek new challenges and push yourself to explore unfamiliar territory in IDM and experimental music production

Remaining committed to your personal growth, creative exploration, and adaptability will enhance your ability to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of music production.
