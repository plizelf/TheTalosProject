Exercise 105: Melody with Quartal Harmony
- Compose a melody using quartal harmony, which is based on the interval of a perfect fourth rather than traditional major and minor thirds
- Experiment with stacked fourths, creating unique and more open-sounding chords to support your melodic line
- Observe how the use of quartal harmony can create an original harmonic texture and atmosphere in your composition

Exercise 106: Melody Inspired by a Story or Narrative
- Choose a story, novel, or an event in history as inspiration for your melody
- Translate the characters, emotions, or plot elements from the story into pitches, rhythms, and contours for your melody
- Reflect on how the narrative inspiration influences the emotional impact, structure, and character of your melody

Exercise 107: Melody with Polymeter
- Write a melody that incorporates polymeter, which is the simultaneous use of two or more different meters or time signatures
- Experiment with different combinations of meters and observe the rhythmic interplay between them in your melody
- Assess how the use of polymeter affects the overall feel, groove, and complexity of your composition

Exercise 108: Melody with Lydian Dominant Scale
- Compose a melody using the Lydian Dominant scale (also known as the Lydian b7 scale), which is the Lydian scale with a flattened seventh degree
- Explore the unique harmonic colors and tensions that arise from the Lydian Dominant scale, such as its augmented fourth and dominant seventh aspects
- Experiment with incorporating Lydian Dominant melodies into different musical contexts or styles to create an intriguing and memorable sound

Exercise 109: Write a Melody as a Dialogue Between Two Instruments
- Compose a melody that features a conversation between two different instruments, with each instrument playing distinct phrases that respond to each other
- Use techniques like call and response, imitation, or unison to create a cohesive and engaging musical interaction between the instruments
- Consider the timbre, range, and playing styles of each instrument when crafting the melodic dialogue to create contrast and interest

By practicing these exercises, you will continue to enhance your melodic abilities while exploring concepts such as quartal harmony, narrative inspiration, polymeter, Lydian Dominant scale, and melodic dialogue between instruments. Embrace the challenges, enjoy the creative journey, and let your exploration guide you toward mastering the art of melody composition.
