- Focus on how the arc structure can guide the listener through the melody, evoking an emotional journey and a sense of story

By practicing these exercises, you'll continue improving your melodic abilities and develop a broader understanding of various techniques, such as motivic transformation, dynamic shifts, texture-based melodies, anticipatory and suspended notes, and arc structures.
