Here are four additional exercises for melody building:

6: Add leaps and intervals
- Using an existing melody or a new one, incorporate more leaps and intervals
- Include both small and large intervals to create a sense of dynamic movement
- Maintain a balance between stepwise motion and leaps in your melody

7: Explore modal melodies
- Experiment with different modes, such as Lydian, Mixolydian, or Dorian for your melody
- Pay attention to the unique and characteristic scale degrees of each mode
- Try combining different modes within the same melody or switching modes between sections

8: Use non-chord tones
- Incorporate non-chord tones like suspensions, appoggiaturas, and escape tones into your melody
- These non-chord tones can add tension and resolution, making your melody more engaging and expressive
- Make sure to resolve non-chord tones properly to avoid dissonance or confusion

9: Create a theme and variation
- Develop a recognizable theme for your melody
- Create variations of the theme by changing the rhythm, adding ornaments, or modulating to a different key
- Combine several variations to form a complete composition or song structure

These exercises will help you further expand your knowledge and skills in creating melodies. Make sure to practice consistently, and above all, have fun experimenting with these techniques. Happy music-making!
