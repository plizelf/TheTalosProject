Exercise 61: Call and Response with Polyphony and Monophony
- Compose a call-and-response melody, with the call phrase played on a polyphonic instrument (e.g., piano or guitar) and the response phrase on a monophonic instrument (e.g., trumpet or flute)
- Design the phrases to have distinct sonic characteristics while maintaining overall musical coherence
- Practice producing a mix that highlights the contrast between the polyphonic and monophonic instruments

Exercise 62: Anticipation and Suspension Harmony Techniques
- Create a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Add anticipation or suspension techniques in the progression by delaying the resolution of a non-chord tone to a chord tone, creating temporary tension
- Analyze the resulting tension and resolution and observe how it affects the emotional impact of the chord progression

Exercise 63: Combining Rhythmic Modes in Melodies
- Compose a melody in a major or minor key
- Combine different rhythmic modes, such as triplet-based rhythms, dotted rhythms, or syncopated rhythms, to form a complex and engaging melodic rhythm
- Evaluate the melodic rhythmâ€™s impact on the overall feel and groove of the composition

Exercise 64: Exploring Altered Chords in Progressions
- Build a chord progression using diatonic chords from a major or minor scale
- Incorporate one or more altered chords into the progression, such as a diminished 7th or augmented chord
- Assess the impact of the altered chords on the progression's character, emotion, and harmonic flow

Exercise 65: Experimenting with Complex Time Signatures
- Choose a complex or uncommon time signature, such as 7/4, 9/8, or 13/16
- Create a chord progression and a melody in the chosen time signature, focusing on crafting a groove and musicality within the unconventional meter
- Observe the unique rhythmic qualities and challenges of composing in complex time signatures and how the choice of meter influences the composition's overall character

Exercise 66: Constructing Melodies with Multiple Voices
- Compose a melody using a major or minor scale
- Add one or more simultaneous melodic voices that harmonize or counterpoint with the original melody, creating richer melodic layers
- Experiment with different voicings, intervals, and rhythms to achieve a complex, yet coherent, melodic texture
