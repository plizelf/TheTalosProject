Certainly! Here's the last set of exercises I provided:

Exercise 85: Melodic and Harmonic Tension and Release Techniques
- Develop a chord progression and melody in a major or minor key that incorporate tension and release techniques, such as using dissonant intervals or non-chord tones that resolve to consonant chord tones
- Experiment with different types and degrees of tension and release, balancing the emotional impact and overall coherence of the composition
- Reflect on how tension and release techniques influence the overall mood, narrative, and dynamics of your music

Exercise 86: Writing Melodies with Call and Response Structures
- Compose a melody that alternates between call and response phrases, where each phrase is related yet distinctly different
- Experiment with various structures of call and response phrases to create a sense of dialog or interaction within the composition
- Arrange the call and response phrases to create an engaging melodic journey or structure throughout the song

Exercise 87: Using Quartal and Quintal Harmony
- Create a chord progression using quartal (harmony based on 4th intervals) or quintal (based on 5th intervals) chords, as opposed to the more common tertian harmony (based on 3rd intervals)
- Develop a melody that complements and enhances the unique harmonic textures of your quartal or quintal progression
- Observe the impact of using quartal and quintal harmony on the overall character and emotion of the composition

Exercise 88: Exploring Polyrhythms and Cross-Rhythms in Composition
- Choose a chord progression and compose a melody while incorporating polyrhythms (simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms) or cross-rhythms (interlocking, syncopated rhythmic patterns)
- Experiment with creating complex and engaging rhythmic textures without sacrificing musical coherence and accessibility
- Analyze the impact of these rhythmic techniques on the overall feel, groove, and interest of your composition

Exercise 89: Orchestration Techniques in Mixing
- Arrange and mix a composition that involves both traditional orchestral instruments (strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion) and modern electronic instruments (synths, drum machines, and sampled sounds)
- Experiment with blending the contrasting timbres, dynamics, and articulations of these instruments to create a harmonious and engaging mix
- Employ panning, EQ, and spatial effects to manage the complex sonic landscape and create a clear and immersive listening experience

Exercise 90: Melodic Variation Through Context Change
- Compose a melody using a major or minor scale
- Alter the context of the melody by changing instrumentation, tempo, time signature, or surrounding harmony
- Evaluate how these contextual changes alter the perception and emotional impact of the original melody, and observe how the melody adapts to different musical settings

These exercises were designed to help you continue exploring music theory, harmony, melody, and rhythm in the context of the Notes and Scales chapter. By practicing these exercises, you'll continue to develop your skills in music production, arrangement, and mixing.
