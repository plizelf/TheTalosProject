Exercise 79: Harmonic and Melodic Anticipation Techniques
- Compose a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Develop a melody that anticipates or reinforces the chord changes, using melodic anticipation techniques such as grace notes, appoggiaturas, or syncopated rhythms
- Evaluate the effectiveness of harmonic and melodic anticipation techniques on the emotional impact of the composition and the interaction between melody and harmony

Exercise 80: Experimenting with Non-Diatonic Chord Progressions
- Build a chord progression that incorporates non-diatonic chords (chords containing notes outside of the chosen major or minor scale), such as borrowed chords, chromatic mediants, or Neapolitan chords
- Compare the non-diatonic progression to a purely diatonic progression and observe the impact of non-diatonic chords on harmony, character, and emotional depth

Exercise 81: Exploring Octatonic, Whole Tone, and Blues Scales
- Familiarize yourself with less common scales, such as octatonic (alternating whole and half steps), whole tone (only whole steps), or blues scales
- Compose a melody using one of these unconventional scales and analyze how the unique tonal structure influences the melodic character and mood

Exercise 82: Interweaving Melodic Lines
- Build a composition with multiple independent melodic lines interwoven, utilizing different instruments, timbres, or spatial positions
- Experiment with balancing the interwoven lines in terms of timbre, harmony, and rhythm, creating a coherent yet texturally rich musical piece

Exercise 83: Rhythmic Displacement in Melody and Chords
- Create a melody in a major or minor key using rhythmic displacement, which involves shifting the entire melodic rhythm by a specific number of beats or subdivisions
- Apply rhythmic displacement techniques to your chord progressions, creating unexpected or intriguing harmonic movement that aligns or intentionally clashes with the melodic rhythm

Exercise 84: Composing Counterpoint in Your Arrangement
- Choose a melody or chord progression and compose a contrapuntal line or countermelody that harmonically and rhythmically interacts with the original material
- Practice adhering to or deliberately breaking the traditional rules of counterpoint to achieve the desired level of consonance or dissonance in your composition

These exercises will continue to deepen your understanding of music theory, harmony, melody, and rhythm in the context of the Notes and Scales chapter. As you become more proficient in these areas, experiment with new concepts and techniques, and you'll be better equipped to tackle complex projects and create unique, engaging music compositions. Keep embracing challenges, stay curious, and enjoy the process of learning and growing in the world of music production.
