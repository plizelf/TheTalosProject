Exercise 91: Creating Meaningful Melodic Phrases
- Compose a melody in a major or minor key that consists of meaningful, connected phrases with coherent musical ideas
- Experiment with variations in phrasing using dynamics, articulation, and ornamentation to convey a sense of emotion or storytelling within the melody
- Reflect on how the structure, phrasing, and melodic development contribute to the overall musicality and expressiveness of the composition

Exercise 92: Harmonic Rhythms in Chord Progressions
- Develop a chord progression with varying harmonic rhythms, such as mixing long-held chords with shorter or syncopated chords, to create a dynamic and engaging harmonic structure
- Coordinate the harmonic rhythm with the other musical elements in your arrangement, including melody, bassline, and percussion
- Analyze the effect of varying harmonic rhythm on the energy, pacing, and overall feel of your music

Exercise 93: Complex Tempo and Time Signature Changes
- Compose a piece with multiple sections, incorporating changes in tempo and time signature between sections
- Manage the transitions between sections to create smooth, coherent connections, utilizing tools such as tempo ramps, time signature modulation, or bridge segments
- Evaluate the impact of tempo and time signature changes on the overall narrative, energy, and stylistic variety of the composition

Exercise 94: Exploring Triplet-based and Quintuplet-based Rhythms
- Create a melody or rhythm pattern that employs triplet-based (3 equal subdivisions per beat) or quintuplet-based (5 equal subdivisions per beat) rhythms
- Experiment with juxtaposing these non-binary subdivisions against the more common binary rhythms (e.g., eighth or sixteenth notes) in your arrangement
- Assess how the use of triplet-based and quintuplet-based rhythms injects texture, interest, or even tension into your music

Exercise 95: Creative Use of Harmonic Extensions
- Compose a chord progression that utilizes harmonically rich chords featuring 9ths, 11ths, or 13ths extensions
- Experiment with different inversions and voicings of these extended chords to achieve varied harmonic textures and suggest diverse moods or atmospheres
- Analyze the impact of the harmonic extensions on the progression's emotional depth, complexity, and character

Exercise 96: Integrating Motifs in Multiple Layers of an Arrangement
- Create a short melodic or rhythmic motif that serves as a thematic element for your composition
- Seamlessly integrate the motif into multiple layers of your arrangement, such as the melody, bassline, pads, or percussion, using techniques like transposition, repetition, or variation to maintain continuity and interest
- Observe how the motif becomes a unifying or connecting factor across the different elements of your composition, establishing a sense of unity and overall coherence
