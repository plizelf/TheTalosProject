Exercise 7: Interval ear training
- Listen to different intervals (major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 5th, etc.) and attempt to recognize each interval by ear
- Test your ear by playing random intervals and identifying them without looking at the piano roll or instrument
- Understanding and recognizing intervals will help you identify the structure of melodies and harmonies, as well as assist in composing on the fly

Exercise 8: Compose with motifs
- Create a 1- to 2-bar melodic motif using a major or minor scale
- Develop a 16-bar melody using your motif as a foundation, incorporating repetitions, variations, and transformations to create a cohesive melodic passage

Exercise 9: Write a counter-melody
- Use a melody you've previously written or create a new one
- Compose a counter-melody that works harmonically and rhythmically alongside the original melody, providing either harmony or contrast

Exercise 10: Study the chord progressions of existing songs
- Analyze the chord progressions in several songs from different genres
- Identify the patterns or structures used in these progressions, and understand how they contribute to the overall mood and feel of the songs

Exercise 11: Chord inversions and voice leading
- Create a chord progression using diatonic chords from a major or minor key
- Experiment with using chord inversions on some of the chords to create smooth, connected voice leading between the chords
- This exercise will help you create more harmonically interesting progressions and enhance your compositions

Exercise 12: Melodies with rhythmic syncopation
- Choose a major or minor scale and create a melody with rhythmic syncopation by placing some notes off the main beats (using offbeats, ties, or rests)
- Develop an engaging melody that uses syncopated rhythms to create a sense of movement and excitement
