83: Mix analysis and critique with peers
- Share your mixes with fellow musicians, producers, or engineers to gather constructive feedback, identify strengths, and address areas for improvement
- Develop your listening and communication skills by engaging in active discussions focused on mixing and mastering techniques and decisions
- Incorporate the insights gained from these critiques into your future projects, refining your mixing and mastering approaches

84: Advanced stereo imaging and manipulation
- Experiment with advanced stereo imaging and manipulation techniques, such as Haas effect processing, micro-shifting, or mid-side stereo expansion
- Utilize these techniques to achieve greater clarity, separation, and depth in your mix by placing elements strategically within the stereo field
- Assess the impact of advanced stereo manipulation on mono compatibility, ensuring the mix retains its balance and definition on various playback systems

85: Creative processing using dynamic EQ
- Explore creative applications of dynamic EQ in your mix, such as frequency-based ducking, precision transient enhancement, or targeted harmonic manipulation
- Use dynamic EQ as a powerful yet transparent solution for common mix challenges like masking, muddiness, or tonal imbalance
- Compare the results achieved using dynamic EQ with traditional static EQ or multiband compression, evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of each approach

86: Mixing with sub-harmonic generators and exciters
- Learn to utilize sub-harmonic generators and exciters to add warmth, fullness, or air to specific mix elements or the mix as a whole
- Experiment with blending and balancing sub-harmonic content with the original audio, maintaining a natural and well-defined sound
- Evaluate the impact of these enhancements on the frequency balance, dynamic range, and overall mix quality

87: Advanced strategies for managing mix bus processing
- Develop an understanding of advanced mix bus processing techniques, including parallel bus compression, mix bus saturation, and mastering-grade EQ or limiting
- Determine the appropriate balance of mix bus processing, ensuring the mix retains its character and dynamics without becoming over-processed or distorted
- Experiment with different combinations of mix bus processing, noting how each approach affects the quality, depth, and cohesion of the final mix

By consistently working on these and other advanced mixing and mastering exercises, you'll continue to expand your skillset and gain deeper insights into various concepts and techniques. Persistence, curiosity, and open-mindedness are essential to your growth and success as a music producer and audio engineer. Embrace challenges, explore new techniques, and savor the process of continuous learning and creative evolution in the world of mixing and mastering.
