73: Creating contrast and dynamics in your mix
- Develop techniques for creating contrasts and dynamics within your mix, such as automating volume, EQ, and effects throughout different song sections
- Explore how contrast and dynamics contribute to the emotional impact and engagement of your mix—the storytelling aspect of music production
- Analyze reference mixes for their use of dynamics and contrast, and apply the insights gained to your own projects

74: Mixing in mono for better translation
- Practice mixing in mono—collapsing your mix into a single channel—and developing techniques for ensuring your mix translates well across various playback systems
- Focus on achieving clarity, balance, and separation in mono, particularly for key mix elements such as vocals, bass, and drums
- Use this mono mixing perspective to make better mixing decisions when returning to stereo, achieving a mix that translates better across different sound systems

75: Advanced bus processing
- Explore advanced bus processing techniques, such as parallel compression, mid-side processing, or frequency-dependent compression on group buses or submixes
- Experiment with creative bus processing combinations to add character and cohesiveness to groups of instruments or the overall mix
- Assess the impact of creative bus processing on clarity, balance, and the overall sonic quality of your mix

76: Incorporating analog warmth and character
- Familiarize yourself with analog emulation plugins that can impart warmth, character, or non-linearity to your digital mixes, such as tape, console, or tube emulations
- Experiment with adding subtle analog warmth and character to individual tracks, buses, or even the mix bus
- Analyze the impact of these analog emulations on the overall mix and identify areas where the added character improves or detracts from the mix's quality

77: Adaptive mixing approach
- Develop the skill of adapting your mixing approach based on the unique requirements of each project, such as live recordings, electronic productions, or orchestral arrangements
- Learn to identify the specific challenges and requirements of each type of project and apply the appropriate mixing techniques accordingly
- Enhance your music production flexibility by effectively tailoring your mixing methodologies to accommodate various recording styles, genres, or project goals
