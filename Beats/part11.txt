Exercise 71: Transform melody or harmony into a drum pattern
- Choose a melody or chord progression, and analyze its rhythmic structure
- Create a drum pattern inspired by the melody or chord progression, emulating the note durations, accents, and phrasings
- Experiment with interlocking the drum pattern and the original melody or harmony within your composition

Exercise 72: Drum patterns with pitch automation
- Develop a drum pattern using pitch-sensitive elements (e.g., toms, pitched percussion, melodic drum samples)
- Apply pitch automation to specific drum elements or segments, creating an evolving melodic contour within the pattern
- Explore how the pitch automation adds new dimensions and melodic interest to your drum pattern

Exercise 73: Create a drum pattern in a compound meter
- Set your project's time signature to a compound meter like 6/8, 9/8 or 12/8
- Compose a drum pattern that embraces the characteristics of the compound meter, focusing on strong and weak beats
- Experiment with transitions and rhythmic variations that highlight the unique groove of the compound meter

Exercise 74: Experiment with drum patterns using microtonal tuning
- Explore microtonal scales or tunings and use them to create pitched drum patterns or tuned percussion elements
- Develop a beat that incorporates these microtonal elements, blending them with traditional 12-tone percussion and drum elements
- Analyze how microtonality adds new harmonic colors and unconventional rhythms to your drum pattern

Exercise 75: Drum patterns inspired by nature or real-world events (Part II)
- Sample or generate drum sounds based on natural events or occurrences (e.g. footsteps, leaves rustling, water dripping)
- Create a drum pattern using these samples to generate a sense of connection with the natural world or the original sampled event
- Explore layering these natural samples with traditional drum elements to create a unique and distinctive drum pattern

Exercise 76: Tempo and time signature modulation
- Develop a drum pattern that modulates between different time signatures and tempos simultaneously (e.g., 7/8 at 140 BPM to 5/4 at 120 BPM)
- Create smooth transitions between changes in time signature and tempo, ensuring the overall pattern retains a constant sense of groove and musical flow
- Explore complex rhythm modulations to challenge your creativity and the listener's attention

Exercise 77: Create a drum pattern based on a specific song structure
- Choose a specific song structure (e.g., verse-chorus-verse or AABA)
- Develop multiple drum patterns tailored for each section of the song structure, considering energy level, accents, and syncopation in each part
- Arrange the drum patterns with seamless transitions across the song structure, showcasing diversity and progression in your beat-making

Exercise 78: Develop a drum pattern using an audio-to-MIDI converter
- Use a DAW's audio-to-MIDI conversion feature (or a third-party plugin) to analyze an audio recording of a rhythm, melody, or harmony
- Convert the audio recording to a MIDI clip and assign drum sounds to the corresponding MIDI notes
- Edit and refine the MIDI-output drum pattern by adding or removing elements, ensuring the rhythm and groove are maintained and enhanced

Exercise 79: Create a drum pattern using unconventional audio effects
- Design a drum pattern and apply audio effects (such as granular synthesis, extreme glitching, or audio morphing) not typically associated with drum sounds
- Focus on preserving a clear sense of groove and rhythm, even as the audio effects push your drum elements into uncharted territory
- Enhance your beat with a unique palette of sounds that sets it apart from conventional drum patterns

Exercise 80: Develop a drum pattern using mixed meters
- Create a drum pattern that alternates between two or more different time signatures, such as 4/4 and 7/8
- Experiment with varying drum elements and accents in each meter, highlighting the unique character of each time signature
- Focus on maintaining a consistent rhythm and groove across the alternating meters and transitions

By completing these advanced exercises, you'll sharpen your beat-making skills and creative abilities, exploring a wide variety of rhythmic techniques and concepts. Continuous experimentation and learning from different musical styles will help you push your music production boundaries and develop a unique approach to crafting drum patterns.
