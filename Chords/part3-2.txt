Exercise 19: Chord Progression Ambiguity
- Select a root note and create a simple chord progression without using traditional major or minor triads (experiment with suspended or added tone chords)
- Assess how the chords create an ambiguous harmonic sense, giving your progression a unique and unconventional feel

Exercise 20: Four-Part Chord Writing
- Choose a chord progression in major or minor key
- Compose a four-part arrangement of the progression (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), using proper voice leading and avoiding parallel fifths and octaves
- Experiment with different inversions, spacing and textures to create a balanced and harmonically appealing result

Exercise 21: Chord Progression Modulation
- Create an 8-bar chord progression in a major or minor key, and develop a related 8-bar modulation to a new key, connected by a pivot chord (a chord that naturally occurs in both keys)
- Explore how the modulation adds interest, complexity, and movement to the harmonic progression

Exercise 22: Chord Tone Composition
- Develop a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Compose a melody using primarily chord tones (root, 3rd or 5th), choosing the supportive tone for each chord from your progression to create a harmonically strong melody

Exercise 23: Arpeggio-Based Composition
- Construct a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Develop a melody or bassline derived primarily from arpeggiated chord patterns, moving in a stepwise, ascending or descending manner

Exercise 24: Rhythmic Variation in Chords
- Create a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Experiment with applying different rhythmic patterns to the chords for added energy and interest (e.g., syncopation, eighth or sixteenth note beats, dotted rhythms)
