Great! Here are exercises to practice and test your understanding of the Chords chapter from Ableton's Learning Music, following the exercise style you enjoyed:

Exercise 1: Diatonic Triads
- Choose a major or minor scale
- Construct diatonic triads (3-note chords) for each scale degree
- Practice playing or entering these chords into your DAW, familiarizing yourself with the structure of diatonic chords in a major or minor key

Exercise 2: Chord Progression Basics
- In a major or minor scale, write a four-chord progression using the I, IV, V (and vi, if minor) scale degree chords
- Create a simple rhythmic pattern for the chords, such as whole notes or half notes, to understand how chords can form the harmonic foundation of a composition

Exercise 3: Adding Rhythm to Chord Progressions
- Take a chord progression you have created or generate a new one
- Add rhythmic variety to the chords by introducing various note values (half notes, quarter notes, etc.), syncopation, or even arpeggiation
- Experiment with different rhythmic styles to build an engaging and dynamic chord progression

Exercise 4: Seventh Chords
- Choose a major or minor scale
- Build diatonic seventh chords (4-note chords) for each scale degree
- Practice playing these chords or entering them into your DAW, becoming comfortable with building and recognizing different types of seventh chords

Exercise 5: Major and Minor Chord Inversions
- Select a major or minor triad (3-note chord)
- Invert the chord by rearranging its notes (root, 3rd, or 5th), ascending or descending
- Practice building and playing the inversions of major and minor chords to understand their use in different harmonic contexts

Exercise 6: Chord Progression with Inversions
- Develop a four-chord progression in a major or minor key
- Experiment with placing one or more chords in inverted positions to create a smoother, continuous progression with connected chord voicings
- Analyze the effect of using chord inversions on the overall sound and voice leading of the progression

These exercises will help solidify your understanding of chords and harmony, building on the content explored in the Chords chapter. By practicing composing and playing chord progressions, inversions, and rhythms, you will strengthen your music production skills and create more engaging and diverse compositions.
