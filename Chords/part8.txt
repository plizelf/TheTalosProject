Exercise 49: Harmonic Movement by Thirds or Seconds
- Construct a chord progression in a major or minor key that moves primarily by thirds (both major and minor thirds) or seconds (major and minor seconds) instead of the more common fifths of circle progressions
- Explore how these progressions create a unique sense of harmonic motion and offer opportunities for unconventional melodic patterns

Exercise 50: Chord Progression with Diminished Seventh Chords
- Build a chord progression in a major or minor key

- Analyze the unique harmonic qualities and characteristics imparted by composing within the Mixolydian mode

Exercise 52: Chord Progressions Moving in Parallel Motion
- Develop a chord progression in a major or minor key
- Create a parallel motion progression by transposing the entire progression to another major or minor key while maintaining the same interval structure between the chords
- Experiment with different parallel keys and analyze the resulting harmonic colors and shifts

These exercises address various aspects of chords, harmony, and chord progressions in music production. By practicing these techniques and exploring different ways to generate harmony, your skills and creativity as a music producer will continue to expand.
