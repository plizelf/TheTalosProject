## TL;DR

The Talos Project is currently an exercise-based curriculum designed to teach the skills necessary to create Braindance music.

## Exercise Modules

- Audio Editing and Time Manipulation
- Automations
- Basslines
- Beats
- Chords
- Generative and Algorithmic Composition
- Melodies
- MIDI Programming and Editing
- Mindset
- Mixing and Mastering
- Notes and Scales
- Song Structure


The modules were inspired by [Ableton's interactive music making resource](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) and extended by what GPT-4 thought was missing (it did mention Sound Design that I forgot to include).

Each module is designed to provide a comprehensive and practical learning experience, allowing the learner to develop their skills and become proficient in creating Braindance music.

For example, the Beats module includes exercises such as creating a basic drum pattern, layering multiple rhythms, adding swing and shuffle, and incorporating polyrhythms.

Similarly, other modules include exercises such as designing a bassline, constructing chords and progressions, programming MIDI patterns, and mastering the final mix.

## Structure of the Curriculum

Each module consists of a series of exercises and challenges that the learner must complete in order to progress to the next level. The exercises are designed to be hands-on, allowing the learner to apply the concepts they have learned in a practical setting.
