Exercise 56: Reversing Song Structure
- Compose a chord progression and melody for your song structure with distinct sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus, bridge)
- Develop an alternative version of your song where the structure's order is reversed (e.g., bridge, chorus, verse, intro)
- Assess how the reversed structure affects the overall flow, storytelling, and dynamics of the composition

Exercise 57: Developing a Concept Album or EP
- Choose a central theme, concept, or story you want to explore through music

Exercise 58: Song Structure with Unexpected Section Changes
- Create a chord progression and melody in a major or minor key for your song structure
- Experiment with incorporating unexpected changes between sections, such as sudden tempo shifts, drastic dynamic changes, or surprising chord modulations
- Analyze how these unexpected changes impact the listener's experience, the song's flow, and the overall structure

Exercise 59: Creating a Song Structure with Harmonic Movements
- Compose a chord progression that features various harmonic movements, such as ascending or descending movement, chromatic lines, or circle of fifths progression
- Develop a song structure that showcases these harmonic movements, focusing on how they create tension, release, or emotion throughout the arrangement
- Examine the impact of these harmonic movements on your song's structure, dynamics, and overall storytelling
