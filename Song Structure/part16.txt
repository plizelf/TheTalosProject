- Create your original composition that utilizes a new and modified version of the chosen song's structure
- Analyze how the modified structure affects the overall arrangement, storytelling, and engagement of your new composition

Exercise 82: Experimenting with Dynamics in Song Structure
- Develop a chord progression and melody in a major or minor key for your song structure
- Create sections within the song structure that exhibit dramatic dynamic changes, utilizing crescendos, diminuendos, or sudden shifts in volume
- Reflect on how the dynamic changes impact the energy, emotional impact, and flow of your song

Exercise 83: Progressive Song Structure
- Compose a song structure that continually develops and evolves throughout its duration, using techniques such as modulations, time signature variations, or melodic transformations
- Focus on creating an engaging and dynamic arrangement that maintains the listener's interest without using traditional song structure patterns
- Examine how the progressive structure affects the storytelling, energy, and overall sense of movement within the composition

Exercise 84: Disrupting Rhythmic Patterns in Song Structure

- Create sections that intentionally disrupt or challenge the established rhythmic patterns, adding excitement or tension through rhythmic syncopation or unexpected beats
- Analyze how the rhythmic disruptions contribute to the structure, flow, and listener engagement of your song

Exercise 85: Call and Response across Song Sections
- Compose a song with distinct sections such as intro, verse, chorus, and bridge or breakdown
- Develop a call and response pattern within different sections by using variations of a theme or having different instruments or sounds respond to each other
- Reflect on the effectiveness of the call and response in keeping the listener engaged and adding variety within your song structure

Practicing these exercises will deepen your understanding of song structure techniques and encourage you to develop innovative approaches in creating engaging, dynamic compositions. By experimenting with a range of styles and techniques, you will continue to grow as a music producer and composer, thereby cultivating your unique creative voice.
