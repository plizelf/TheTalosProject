Certainly! Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind the distribution of weights for each aspect of IDM/experimental alien-like music production:

1. Start with the three most defining aspects of the IDM genre: Beats, Sound Design, and Generative and Algorithmic Composition. Assign a higher weight to these aspects, as they contribute significantly to the unique sound and structure of IDM music. Allocate 55% of the total focus to these three aspects – 20% for Beats, 20% for Sound Design, and 15% for Generative and Algorithmic Composition.

2. Next, consider the aspects that enhance the overall creativity and versatility of IDM music while supporting the primary defining aspects mentioned in step 1. These aspects include Audio Editing and Time Manipulation, Automations, MIDI Programming and Editing, and Song Structure. Since these aspects contribute to the artistic experimentation in IDM, assign them a moderate weight. Allocate 28% of the total focus for these aspects – 10% each for Audio Editing and Time Manipulation and Automations, 5% for MIDI Programming and Editing, and 3% for Song Structure.

3. Now, let's focus on the more traditional elements of music-making that provide a foundation for the more experimental IDM aspects. These include Melodies, Basslines, Chords, and Notes and Scales. Since these traditional elements can inform and enhance innovative IDM productions without dominating the core characteristics, assign them a lower weight. Allocate 16% of the total focus for these aspects – 5% each for Melodies, Basslines, and Chords, and 1% for Notes and Scales.

4. Finally, address the less IDM-specific aspects that have an impact on the overall quality and appeal of your tracks, which are Mixing and Mastering and Mindset. Mixing and Mastering will make your music sound polished, while Mindset refers to maintaining an experimental and open approach to your music production. Assign a lower weight to Mixing and Mastering (1%) as, while important, it is a universal aspect of music production not specific to IDM. Mindset does not receive a weight percentage because it is an ongoing, integral aspect of your music-making journey rather than a specific skill to develop.

Through this step-by-step reasoning process, the initial distribution of weights has been deemed suitable to effectively represent the unique aspects of IDM music and guide a beginner in their music production journey.

There may be several contexts where the weight distribution could change based on individual preferences, goals, or circumstances.

For example, consider three possible contexts:

1. An individual who is already experienced in electronic music production and has strong technical skills could increase the weight on aspects like Sound Design, Generative and Algorithmic Composition, and Automations. They may decrease the weight on fundamental aspects like Melodies, Basslines, and MIDI Programming and Editing, as they may already possess competence in these areas.

2. A classically trained musician who is new to IDM and electronic music production may find it helpful to prioritize Melodies, Basslines, Chords, and Notes and Scales to build upon their pre-existing music theory knowledge. They could reduce the weight on aspects like Beats, Sound Design, and Generative and Algorithmic Composition, gradually increasing their focus on those areas as they become more comfortable with the IDM genre.

3. A beginner who wants to focus mainly on live performances and improvisation within the IDM genre might prioritize aspects like Generative and Algorithmic Composition, MIDI Programming and Editing, and Automations, as these dimensions have a more significant impact on live performances. They could reduce the weight on aspects like Mixing and Mastering and Song Structure, as these elements might have less immediate relevance to their performance goals.

By adjusting the template according to your specific context, you can create a tailored weight distribution that best supports your individual goals and development in IDM music production.
